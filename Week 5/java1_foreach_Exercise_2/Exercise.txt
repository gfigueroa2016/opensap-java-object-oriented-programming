java1 foreach Exercise 2
======================
In this exercise we use the foreach loop to calculate an arithmetic mean (average). There are two methods in class **Calculator**, that take an array of numbers as parameter:

1. **calculateSum()**: Should return the sum of all elements in the array
2. **calculateMean()**: Should  return the arithmetic mean (sum of all elements divided by the number of elements).

Implement the two unfinished methods.  
Use a foreach loop when implementing **calculateSum()**.
